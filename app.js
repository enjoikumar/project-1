//	Project Plan
// PsuedoCode it all out on Tuesday which includes the logic, and knowing what to do. 
//Breaking down every aspect into doable steps

// Tuesday:PsuedoCoding and basic css styling
// Wednesday: Get the java down step-by-step
// the beginning: player inputs
// middle: making the columns correspond to clicks
// end: check for win and a reset button
// Thursday: Css styling and line by line reading finding any type of bug
// YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE, IF YOU'RE DONE
// WORK ON THE NEXT ASPECT
// Maybe a user story to better depict what will go on to better understand the logic
// Wire framing for layout purposes
// Jquery option?

//Requirements
// Two different colors for players (red & black)
// A 2 player game
// The game board should have 7 columns and 6 rows
// Simulating gravity / Only when a row is clicked should a piece move all the way down the column to the next available spot
// So many different winning combinations
// Need to keep in mind of diagonals and such
// That will go in for check/win
// Reset button(window.reload)
// Declare winner to go with the winning combination
// Alert 'name' won at the end or alert 'itâ€™s a tie'
// Require set name
// Make player1/2 an object=name:''/color:'red/black'
// CSS should be taken in consideration last
// But I need to be able to have rows and columns with the grid have circles in it
// Or making a game with boxes, much easier if you cant get the circular tiles to work
// I want the name input to say player1 vs player2 (kk vs cc)
// There are only 42 moves, and each player has 21 moves
